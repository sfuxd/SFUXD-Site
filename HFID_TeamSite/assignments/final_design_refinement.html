					<h1>Final Refinement</h1></a>
					<a id="design-refinement"><h2>Refinement Summary</h2></a>
					
					We decided to make the following three major changes after receiving the heuristic evaluation feedback.
					
					<h3>Simplify the Prototype</h3>
					<p>In our feedback, we learned we have many features that do not function well, and it would be better for us to narrow our focus by removing excess features and making the few features we do keep work really well. We realized that we were overly ambitious in how much we wanted to achieve, so we have decided to scale back. </p>
					<p>In addition, we looked at an existing iPad app called “All Recipes” that already does everything we wanted our recipe book to do (including the timer while cooking and filtering recipes by must/can’t have ingredients). This was encouraging to see as designers because it assures us that the features we were working on are important ones for food choice. However, since this app exists already and implements what we designed at a much higher quality, we decided to focus on the social cooking aspect, which is what makes our app unique. We thought if we could get the event creation and viewing/editing events to work really well, our app would be more successful than if we attempted to include everything and were unable to fully implement many of the features. </p>
					<p>For these reasons, we decided to remove the “Friends' Recipe Books” and the “My Recipe Book” page. This will simplify the app so we can work on the main function: helping users organize events where they cook with their friends. </p>
					<p>Initially, we only removed the friends’ recipebooks, but without the "My Friends' Recipe Books" function, the “My Recipe Book” felt disconnected from the “Create Event” function. The “My Recipe Book” also does not involve friends or support interaction with friends, and it adds complexity. In addition, we found from our early user interviews that users tend to have their own source of recipes, whether online or in physical cards/books, so it is not necessary that our app keep a recipe book for the user. For these reasons, we finally decided to remove the “My Recipe Book” page as well. </p>
					<h3>Modify Event Creation</h3>
					<p>In the process of removing the “My Recipe Book,” we asked ourselves: “What is the function of the ‘My Recipe Book’?” It seemed that the overall purpose of the “My Recipe Book” page was to help people share recipes with friends, view dietary needs, and choose recipes to cook when creating social cooking events. </p>
					<p>One problem with removing the user’s recipe book was that when organizing an event, the user needed to choose a recipe to cook. In our low-fi prototype, the recipe was selected from the “My Recipe Book” page, but that is no longer an option in our refined design. To address this, we made the process of choosing recipes more discussion-based and socially interactive. The event organizer could suggest dishes they would like to cook and ingredients they would like others to bring, and friends attending the event could comment on the dishes, insert links to recipes they found online, and select ingredients they would like to bring. </p>
					<p>We also realized that the recipe books displayed the dietary needs and cooking preferences for each user, which helped event organizers decide what to cook. We plan to address this by including a small icon with each friend on the list of possible people to invite, such as the symbol for gluten-free or vegetarian. Since the user still needs a way of managing their list of friends, we decided to add a simple “My Friends” page that would have the sole function of adding or removing friends from the app.</p>
					<h3>Add Clarity and Character to Visuals</h3>
					<p>We received many design criticisms for the visuals on our app. On the list of upcoming events, it was not clear to the heuristic evaluators that each event was clickable, so we have outlined each event to look more like a clickable button. </p>
					<p>Another button that unclear was the button in the bottom-left corner of the homepage of the app. In the background of the homepage, we had a rotating picture of delicious food pulled from the recipe books of the user’s friends. If the user clicked on the button, the user could view the recipe for the food image. From there, the user could express interest in the friend’s recipe by adding the recipe to his or her own recipe book. However, this button’s function was confusing to the evaluators, and without the “Friends’ Recipe Books” or the “My Recipe Book” pages, this function does not make sense. Instead, we now have a rotating background of food images without the button in the bottom-left corner. We found that including images of food in the background greatly added to the aesthetics of the app, enriching the character of the app. We want the app to be something that users enjoy using and increases their excitement about cooking. </p>
					<p>In addition, we found that consistency was a major issue in our app. There were many buttons with different functions, as well as pages with inconsistent layouts, backgrounds, and text. We have decided to keep the rotating background image consistent on every page and have made every box transparent. In addition, we have standardized the buttons, layout, and text. Finally, we have created a “Cook with Friends” logo that will serve as the button that brings the user back to the home page. </p>
					<p>In summary, we have refined our app by simplifying its functionality, returning it to its basic purpose: to help users organize cooking in person with their friends. </p>
					
					<a id="experiment-design"><h2>Formal Experiment Design</h2></a>
					<p>We will test one version of the prototype, with two factors varied, on each user. We will time the user as they complete two tasks and ask them to think aloud as they use the app. We will also show the user the other version of the prototype and ask whether they prefer one or the other. We expect them to be better at accomplishing each task the second time around, so we will not include the time it takes them to accomplish these tasks in our test results.</p>
					<p>We will ideally have four users that we test so we can test each version of the interface twice. We will test users on Monday and Thursday. Following the Monday usability test, we will make modifications suggested by the users. After the Thursday test, we will choose the version of the prototype that worked best for the users, or some combination of both, and add the finishing touches. </p>
					
					<h3> Independent Variable 1: Friends Page </h3>
					
					<h4> Condition 1: Friends on a Separate Page  </h4>
					<p>With the “My Friends’ Recipe Books” and “My Recipe Book” pages gone, we had more space on the homepage. We still needed a way to manage friends, so we thought of two variations. For the first version, the friends list is on a separate page accessed by clicking the “Friends” button on the homepage. From this page, friends can be added and removed, which makes it similar to early versions of the design. </p>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/mainpage_v1.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 1. The homepage where the friends page is accessed by a button. </h5>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/friends_v1.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 2. The friends page that allows viewing, adding, and deleting friends. </h5>
					<p>Our concern with the “Friends” collection being on a separate page is that this might take more time, and if the user is trying to add a friend while planning an event, the user would need to exit out of the planning of an event, navigate to the friends page, add the friend, navigate back to the homepage, and then restart the planning of an event.</p>
					
					<h4> Condition 2: Friends in a Tab with Upcoming Events on the Homepage </h4>
					<p>Our other design variation is to have the friends feature in a tabbed box with the upcoming events list on the homepage. The idea behind this is that keeping the friends on the home screen makes the friends more accessible and faster to navigate. </p>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/mainpage_v2.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 3. The homepage when the Upcoming Events tab is selected. </h5>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/friends_v2.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 4. The homepage when the Friends tab is selected. </h5>
					<p>The potential problem with this design is that with this reduced space for viewing friends, one must scroll down to see more than eight friends and to add a friend, whereas when the friends’ page is separate, the user can easily see up to 20 friends and add a friend, all without scrolling. </p>					
					
					<h4> Hypothesis </h4>
					<p>We hypothesize that the second condition of the independent variable would enable users to accomplish the task of adding a friend more quickly than the first version. To test this, we will measure the dependent variable of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task of adding a new friend. In addition, we will give the users a survey with a question asking the user to rate the ease of adding a friend on a Likert scale from one to five. We will watch the user interact with the interface to see if the user hesitates anywhere in the process. The better solution will be the one that is easier for users to use and allows them to accomplish the task of adding a friend more quickly.</p>
					
					
					<h3> Independent Variable 2: Creation of an event </h3>

					<h4> Condition 1: Grouping Aspects of Creating an Event </h4>
					<p>In this version, we created four categories of information needed when creating an event and grouped these together. In order to simplify the interface, we grouped together the date, time of day, and location, as well as the name of the event, the dishes to cook, and the necessary ingredients. </p>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/create_event_v1.JPG" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 6. This shows the different steps in creating an event with only four tabs to simplify the process.</h5>

					<h4> Condition 2: Separating Each Event Detail </h4>
					<p>In our other design for the Create Event page, we left most steps for creating an event in separate tabs. This is similar to our original interface design, and allows each page to appear more spacious. However, it also requires more step to create the event.</p>
					<center><img src="../static/images/prototype/create_event_v2.jpg" width="400px"></center>
					<h5> Figure 7. The different steps in organizing an event are separated so that on each page, there is ample room for detail.</h5>

					<h4> Hypothesis </h4>
					<p>We hypothesize that the first condition of the independent variable would enable users to accomplish the task of creating an event more quickly than the second version. To test this, we will measure the dependent variable of the time (in seconds) required to complete the task of creating an event. In addition, we will give the users a survey with a question asking the user to rate the ease of creating an event on a Likert scale from one to five. We will watch the user interact with the interface to see if the user hesitates anywhere in the process. The better solution will be the one that is easier for users to use and allows them to accomplish the task of creating an event more quickly.</p>
					
					<h4> Ideal Conditions </h4>
					<p>Ideally, we would test at least 10 users on each version of the prototype. We would show each user the other version, but they would only be tested on one version. Our team has no prior experience in the design of controlled experiments.</p>
					
					<a id="test-script"><h3> Test Script </h3></a>
					<h4> Informed Consent</h4>
					<p>Hello, thank you for helping us out today. The usability test we are conducting today will help us learn how to improve the usability of our functional prototyped interface design. We will ask you to complete several tasks, as well as fill out a follow-up survey with some demographic information and other comments. Please think aloud as you work through the tasks. Do not worry about making mistakes, since that will be particularly helpful to us in learning which aspects of our design need improvement. Remember you are free to change your mind about the study at any point if you feel uncomfortable. Please read through the informed <a href="consent_form.html">consent form</a>. Do we have your permission to observe you and take notes? </p>
					<h4> Intro</h4>
					<p>You want to schedule a cooking event with some friends for next weekend. You go to your social cooking app. This is the front page. </p>
					<h4>Upcoming Events Scenario</h4>
					<p>Look at your upcoming events. Go to the ones you are invited to, and look at the event details. You have flour and butter, so if the recipe calls for flour or butter, let the organizer know you can bring it. Please suggest making snicker doodles to Allie.</p>
					<h4>Create an Event Scenario [We will time how long it takes the user to complete this task.]</h4>
					<p>Now, create an event. You want to title it “Dessert Party!”, and you would like to make this recipe:</p>

					<h3> Test Results </h3>
					<p>We interviewed three users and conducted the formal usability study on each. We showed both prototypes to each, but only tested one. Prototype 1 combined condition 1 for variable 1 and condition 2 for variable 2. Prototype 2 combined condition 2 for variable 1 and condition 1 for variable 2. In general, timing the tasks the users completed was inconsistent and not very helpful because the users had varying difficulty with the scrolling feature, and some talked more as they worked through the process. We gained the most valuable information by observing he users complete the tasks and talking to them afterwards about which aspects of each prototype they preferred.</p>
					<p>As a result of the formal usability test observations, we decided to select condition 1 of variable 1 (placing friends on their own page separate from the upcoming events and home page), as well as condition 1 of variable 2 (grouping items on the create an event page, but with the modification that the title of the event is separate from the dishes and ingredients).  It was very clear from all three users that we should separate friends from upcoming events because they serve different purposes in the minds of the users. However, we received conflicting feedback on the create an event page, so we decided to go with what we felt was best. We believe date, time, and location make sense together, and dishes and recipes make sense together, so we left those as groups. This also reduces the number of steps required to create an event, thereby decreasing the time spent on the task. If the results held with a larger user population, we expect that the majority of the users would prefer grouping several of the steps in the task of creating an event. If we had more time, we would work on making the scrolling more intuitive, and we would add "save" buttons to each step in creating an event so that it is more clear to the user how to save the information (instead of requiring them to press "Enter" in order to save the information).</p>
					<h4>User Test 1: Prototype 1</h4>
					<p>Create an Event: 2 minutes, 15 seconds</p>
					<p>Add a Friend: 14 seconds</p>
					<ul> 
							<li>she was unsure how she would correct an error if she made a mistake while entering ingredients</li> 
							<li>she would like the comment textbox to automatically clear the default text</li>
							<li>she liked the time and date being grouped together</li>
							<li>she thought it made made more sense to separate the event title from the dishes and ingredients</li>
							<li>she found the background images nonintrusive, beautiful, and appetizing</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>User Test 2: Prototype 2</h4>
					<p>Create an Event: 4 minutes</p>
					<p>Add a Friend: 1 minute, 20 seconds</p>
					<ul> 
							<li>she didn't notice she had to hit "enter" until she reached the last textbox </li> 
							<li>she wanted to fix one item on the ingredients list, but couldn't</li>
							<li>she was sad that the ingredients list went off the screen</li>
							<li>she would probably give people an address instead of the name of a location</li>
							<li>she wasn't sure where to find the comments until she clicked on the summary tab</li>
							<li>she couldn't figure out how to scroll through the friends list, and thus, she couldn't find the "add friend" button</li> 
							<li>she deleted friends in order to get to the bottom of the list so that she could finally add a friend</li>
							<li>she had a hard time reading some of the text and wished the transparency was a little more opaque</li>
							<li>she liked the first version better because she preferred separating all the event items, except for the date and time (because they make sense together)</li>
							<li>she would prefer the friends button with the create event button instead of underneath the upcoming events</li>
							<li>she liked the friends button better than the tab because she thought friends and upcoming events were unrelated</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>User Test 3: Prototype 2</h4>
					<p>Create an Event: 3 minutes, 19 seconds</p>
					<p>Add a Friend: 15 seconds</p>
					<ul>
						<li>he hesitated when inputting ingredients but understood when he pressed enter and the ingredient was added to the list</li>
						<li>he did not realize that he needed to press enter in order to submit each item and thus had to backtrack; he requested that the "press enter to save" instruction be repeated among all of the textboxes requiring that action</li>
						<li>he was bothered by the fact that he could not see the event he added and the friend he added (note that this is a recognized limitation of the prototype)</li>
						<li>he took a while to find the ingredients he was requested to check off and mentioned that this is an inherent quality to recipes--the ingredients are not ordered and therefore finding the right ones takes time</li>
						<li>he preferred the separate friends page because more information was visible</li>
						<li>he preferred the create event page with separated date, time, location, etc. (version 1) because he felt it was more straightforward</li>
						<li>he noted that the My Friends title on the friends' page looks like a button</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>Many people enjoy cooking with their friends, but the coordination and planning of an event are hindered by poor communication channels. For example, emailing or calling friends to coordinate a cooking event requires looking up friends’ email addresses or phone numbers, remembering all the details of the event when sending that one email or making that one call, and checking a calendar to determine which days and times will work. Emails are sent back and forth, with people suggesting alternatives. Often, if schedules conflict, people give up on planning the event and decide to reschedule for an indeterminate future date.</p>
					
					<h3>Solution Overview</h3>
					<p>There are many details to coordinate when organizing a cooking event with friends. The date, time, and location, what dishes to cook, and who will bring which ingredients are just a few of the logistics required to schedule a social cooking event. To make this process quicker and simpler, we designed a tablet application that helps users view, discuss, and coordinate all the details in one place. The user has a list of friends he or she can invite to social cooking events, as well as a list of upcoming cooking events. </p>
					
					<h3>Personas and Scenarios </h3>
					<p>Our personas, Abby and Corinne, are shown <a href="needs_analysis.html#personas">here</a>. We primarily designed for Corinne because she is more organized when scheduling events. However, our design also addresses Abby’s goals and needs. Our final three scenarios are creating an event, adding a friend, and interacting with an event you are invited to, which are the same scenarios we used in our <a href="#test-script">formal usability test script</a>. </p>
					
					<h3>Final Interface Design</h3>
					
					<h4>Functionality </h4>
					<p>“Cooking with Friends” enables a user to create a social cooking event by titling the event, listing the dishes he or she wants to cook and the ingredients that are needed, inviting friends, and suggesting a time and place. The user can view events he or she has created in order to see friends’ comments and what ingredients friends can bring. When the user is invited to a social cooking event, he or she can accept or decline the invitation, as well as volunteer to bring ingredients or leave a comment suggesting another dish or an alternate time/date. This increases everyone’s involvement, which is essential to any successful collaborative cooking experience. Finally, the user can view his or her friend list, add friends, and delete friends.</p>
					
					<h4>Interaction Flow</h4>
					
					<p>After removing the recipe books, our app was simplified to two layers: the main page and three pages that link directly back to the main page, but not to each other (as shown in the image below).</p>
					
					<img src="../static/images/interaction_flow.jpg" width="700px">
					
					<h4>What was left unimplemented? </h4>
					
					<p>Initially, we left out <a href="design_refinement.html#features-left-out">these features</a>. However, when we made our final refinement, we cut out the recipe books completely. Due to time constraints, we were unable to make all the revisions we had hoped to make. For example, we would have liked to replace the “Cooking with Friends” home page button with a nicely designed logo. We also wanted to change selecting a time by entering a string on the create event page to using a dial instead. Instead of merely displaying a pop-up saying information for adding a friend or creating an event had been saved but would not appear, we would have liked to use a database to store the information so that newly created events or added friends would appear. Finally, instead of requiring the user to press “Enter” to save information on the create event page, we would have liked to add a “Save” button so that the function of pressing “Enter” would be reserved for moving to the next step in the event creation process.</p>
					
					<h4>Tools Used</h4>
					
					<p>We used paper, sticky notes, and sharpies for our initial paper prototypes. We discussed what our major features were, then laid them out in various ways with the help of the removable post-its. Once we agreed on a layout as a team, we made mockups on Balsamiq Mockups. This was an incredibly powerful tool that helped us make many variations of designs quickly and easily. We could spend less time drawing and more time thinking about layout and flow. However, it was more difficult initially to learn to use Balsamiq than it would have been to simply use pen and paper.</p>
					
					<p>We used a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to implement our prototype. The problem with this approach was that only one team member was comfortable using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Although all team members did learn a lot in the process, the learning curve was quite steep, especially for the Javascript. We also used Github for version control, which made the collaborative coding process much easier. The most difficult aspect of this was due to accidentally writing over another team member’s changes if one team member forgot to “pull” from the git repository before “pushing” their changes to the repository.</p>
					
					<h3>Design Evolution</h3>
					
					<h4>Needs Analysis</h4>
					<p>We thought people would enjoy cooking with friends, so we set up interviews to ask people about their cooking habits, their social life, and their use of technology. What we found was that there are a lot of young people who like to cook with friends, older people tend to see cooking more as a chore, and parents tend to see their friends as rarely as once a month. Also, people over 50 tend to not be especially tech-savvy. This directed our design for a social cooking app towards a younger group of people who socialize more, still enjoy cooking, and are comfortable with technology. </p>
					
					<p>With the knowledge from our interviews, we wrote out scenarios that illustrated the process of organizing a cooking event. We create a flow diagram for the process and identified pain points. We then created Storyboards, which are rough proposals of apps that could be made to address the pain points of our users. Some pain points were deciding what to cook, making sure all ingredients were acquired, and deciding on logistics. If you would like to learn more about any part of this process, you can read about it <a href="needs_analysis.html">here</a>. </p>
					
					<h4>Design Development</h4>
					
					During the paper prototyping phase, we pieced together our ideas from storyboard sketches to create two variations on what our app could be. In the end, because our primary persona was Corinne, we chose to focus on one that was more about organizing events than socializing on the app. We had four pages at this point: Home page, Friends page, Create Event page, and Recipe Countertop page (later renamed Recipe Book). You can see a breakdown of features for these pages <a href="design_development.html#idea-development">here</a>.
					
					<h4>Design Refinement</h4>
					
					<p>Our Design Refinement came out of usability tests with our users. We learned that some of the functions of our app were not clear. For example, users did not know how to use the timeline, and users did not know how to filter recipes. The purpose of some buttons was also unclear. Many of our changes in this stage were visual and organizational. We changed the timeline from vertical to horizontal. This allowed us to display more text, and with more text, the function of the timeline was clearer. Users could now see upcoming events with enough details for the feature to be valuable. We also changed the interaction with Friends’ recipes and the flow from the homepage to a friend’s recipe book page. While we added some features at this stage, we left out some features we did not consider high priority. Our revised interface design is described <a href="design_refinement.html#revised-mockup">here</a>. A summary of the major changes we made to the prototype is listed <a href="design_refinement.html#major-changes">here</a>.</p>
					
					<p>In this step, we also ran a cognitive walkthrough, and though this process, we realized that a key page was missing. There was no edit event page for people who wanted to interact with other people’s events, so we created one. </p>
					
					<h4>Final Refinement</h4>
					
					Our Final Refinement stage followed our Heuristic Evaluations. We learned from our Heuristic Evaluations that we needed to seriously rethink the design of our app. It was overloaded with features, like Alan Cooper’s proverbial Dancing Bear, and it was not accomplishing much of anything well. We refocused the purpose of the app: to help users organize cooking events with their friends. With this in mind, we eliminated all the recipe books. Our final refinement after the heuristic evaluation is described <a href="#refinement-summary">here</a>.</p>
					
					<h4>Final Prototype</h4>
					
					We considered several variations for our final prototype. We needed to figure out how to layout the event creation process and how to connect the Friends List to the rest of the app. In the end, we decided on keeping the Friends List on its own page, accessible from a button on the homepage. The event creation process was grouped into details that are related to each other. Other changes we made include automatically clearing the default comment text, enabling the deletion of one dish/ingredient at a time, and adding accept/decline buttons. These design decisions were made based on what made more sense to our users and what helped the users work through the app most quickly.  If you are curious about our process and would like to read more about our Formal Experiment Design, you can access it <a href="#experiment-design">here</a>.
					
					<!-- <p>During the paper prototyping phase, we described <a href="design_development.html#idea-development">here</a> which UI designs we moved forward with in Balsamiq from the initial storyboard sketches. After testing our paper prototypes on users, we revised our interface design as described <a href="design_refinement.html#revised-mockup">here</a>. A summary of the major changes we made to the prototype is listed <a href="design_refinement.html#major-changes">here</a>. Our final refinement after the heuristic evaluation is described <a href="#refinement-summary">here</a>.</p>
					
					<h4>Final Revisions</h4>
					
					[Colby's part goes here] -->
					
					<h4>The Most Helpful Step</h4>
					
					<p>The Heuristic Evaluation was by far the most helpful evaluation technique for our project. Up until that point, we were steadily expanding the capability of our app to cover the entire cooking experience, from deciding what to cook all the way to helping users cook, by adding features such as timers and photo-taking. From our Heuristic Evaluation, it was clear that we could not accomplish everything that we wanted to do in the limited time available, and that our app would not be fully functional if we continued with the current design. Therefore, we decided to simplify our app significantly. Simplifying our app has been the best decision our team made this whole semester. Before the simplification took place, everyone on the team was feeling overwhelmed and concerned about the outcome of the project, but with a smaller scope, we were able to focus more on what could be done. By limited ourselves to the event creation process, we have greatly improved the few features that are most important to the user experience. The app is now simpler, more beautiful, and easier to use than before.</p>
