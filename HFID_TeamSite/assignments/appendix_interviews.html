					<h3> Neel ***JAMES*** </h3>
					<p>  </p>
					<h3> Nate ***NICK*** </h3>
					<p>  </p>
					<h3> Rebecca ***KATJE*** </h3>
					<p> Rebecca is a student at Wellesley College.  She cooks at home, but she does not cook at school due to the lack of clean kitchens to use.  Rebecca was not a participant in the first phase of the project but was enthusiastic about the idea of a social cooking app.  </p>
					<p>  </p>
					<h3> Steph ***RACHAEL*** </h3>
					<p>  </p>
					<h3> Elena ***ILANA*** </h3>
					<p>  Elena enjoys baking with friends, though she only has time to do this a few times each month.  She fits very much within Abby's persona--when she bakes, she likes to work at a relaxed pace and chat with her friends.  Elena was not a part of our original interviews, but she was excited to help us perform usability testing. </p>
					<p> Elena did not have any issues completing any of the tasks we set for her.  She moved smoothly through the "Create Event" interface and was able to look at the recipes and friends pages.  The scrolling of the timeline as originally implemented was not intuitive to her; she felt that a touch-scrolling interface was natural but that she would prefer the timeline simply moved to the side rather than pinch-zooming. </p>
					<p> Elena wanted to try out all of the functionality of the app, and unfortunately we did not have every available function prototyped.  She did, however, express interest in all the functionality stubs we had in place, such as the uploading of a new recipe and the looking at friends' recipe books.  She was somewhat confused by the picture in the background of the main page and how that related to the button in the lower left, but she was excited about the prospect of background images of friends' recipes once we explained the concept. </p>
					<h3> Adelaide ***ADELA*** </h3>
					<p>  </p>
					<h3> Peter ***PHILIP*** </h3>
					<p> Peter cooks on rare occasions, and most of the time he cooks for his friends rather than with his friends.  When time permits, though, he enjoys having company in the kitchen. </p>
					<p> Peter found the interface quite  </p>
					<h3> Mohammad ***KUP-KUP*** </h3>
					<p>  </p>
					<h3> Philip ***BRAM*** </h3>
					<p> Philip is a 27-year-old tech-savvy designer.  ... </p>
					<h3> Lydia ***REBECCA*** </h3>
					<p> Lydia is a 26-year-old architect.  She is somewhat tech-savvy, though not as much as Philip (whom she is dating).  ... </p>
