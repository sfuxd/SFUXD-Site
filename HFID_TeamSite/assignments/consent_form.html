					<p>Information from Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, Needham, MA 02492 10Sept2012 v3</p>
					<p>Our names are Joe Gibson, Molly Grossman, Mandy Korpusik, and Colby Sato. We are students at Olin College of Engineering studying people who enjoy social cooking for a class on Human Factors and Interface Design. We can be contacted by phone on 808-349-5033 or by email at colby.sato@students.olin.edu.</p>
					<p>We are studying the intersection of planning socializing with friends and planning a meal. The successful completion of these two combined yields a desirable experience. Over the course of the semester we will be investigating current systems/tools and practices, and we will design a prototype system that we hope provides a better interface than existing ones.</p>
					<p>Early in the semester, we will be observing and interviewing current users. Later in the semester we will be asking users to help us test our prototype system. We will observe participants and ask about the process to improve the design.</p>
					<p>The results of this research, including field notes, records and photos that you or we take, will be used for educational and research purposes. They will be placed on an Olin College educational website that is public and may be used in presentations by us and by Olin to illustrate the work that we do and/or to help advance engineering and educational work.</p>
					<p>We hope this will be a fun and interesting process for you. We do not anticipate that there would be any unusual risks or discomforts to you as a participant in this project. We would take every reasonable effort to keep your identity confidential. For instance, we would not use your real name in research notes, course assignments or presentations. Please do not disclose any information that you feel would put you at risk.</p>
					<p>Participation is voluntary. You may discontinue your participation at any time without any adverse effects and with no hard feelings.  There will be no costs associated with your participation. We regret that we cannot pay you for your participation.</p>
					<p>If you have any questions or concerns about the project, please contact our professor or us. Our professor is Amon Millner, Visiting Assistant Professor of Computing Innovation. He can be reached at 781-292-2527 or by email at amon.millner@olin.edu.</p>
					<p><b>This project has gone through a mock-IRB process designed specifically to educate students on the human subjects review process. This human subjects review process is not endorsed by an official Institutional Review Board (IRB). It does not constitute formal human subjects review certification.</b></p>
