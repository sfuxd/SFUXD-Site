					<h2>Usability Test Script</h2>
					<h3>Informed Consent</h3>
					<p>The usability test we are conducting today will help us learn how to improve the usability of our paper prototyped interface design. We will ask you to complete several tasks. Please think aloud as you work through the tasks. Do now worry about making mistakes, since that will be particularly helpful to us in learning which aspects of our design need improvement. Remember you are free to change your mind about the study at any point if you feel uncomfortable. </p>
					<h3>Demo</h3>
					<p>This paper prototype represents a tablet application for social cooking. One of us will be simulating the computer. You can use your finger to touch buttons, click on links, scroll through pictures, or anything else you might do with an app. For example, if I click on “Create an Event,” the computer takes me to the “Create an Event” page. To simulate typing, I can write in this text box with a pen. If I click “Cancel,” the computer takes me back to the front page.</p>
					<h3>Intro</h3>
					<p>You want to schedule a cooking event with some friends for next weekend. You go to your social cooking app. This is the front page.</p>
					<h3>Create an Event Scenario</h3>
					<p>Now you’d like to schedule the actual event. You should title the event “Dessert Party!” You decide to make chocolate swirl strawberries with your friends Allie, Dierdre, and Joe on Monday, October 1 at 2:30pm. The location is your house. Please create an event with this information.</p>
					<h3>Find a Recipe Scenario</h3>
					<p>You feel like making dessert, so you look at some of the dessert recipes in your recipe countertop. Please find the dessert recipe that requires the least amount of time. Then return to the home page.</p>
					<h3>My Friends Scenario</h3>
					<p>Yesterday you met a new colleague at work, and over lunch you discovered a common interest in good food. You decide to add him to your social cooking app. Please navigate to the “My Friends” page and add your new friend. His name is Adam Brown, and his email address is adam.brown@gmail.com. Then return to the home page.</p>
					<h3>Timeline Scenario</h3>
					<p>You receive a new event notification on the timeline, and you want to see who invited you and what the event is. Then accept the invitation.</p>
					<h3>Debrief</h3>
					<p>Thank you so much for helping us test our prototype! We can show you how we intended the interface to work. We have also recorded any questions or issues that arose during the interview, and will address those now.</p>
